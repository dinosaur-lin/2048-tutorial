  (********* Step 1 *********)

  (* Your first task is to fix the code so that the tests pass.
     `is_board_winning` is directly tested whereas `is_square_2048` is not,
     so you'll have to implement both functions below before
     you begin to see the tests pass. *)

  (* TODO: Complete the function `is_square_2048`. The function should
     return `true` if a square has the value `2048` and `false`
     otherwise. *)
  let is_square_2048 (sq : square) = sq == t2048

  (* TODO: * Write the `is_board_winning` function. The `List.exists` function
     (which you can try out in an IOCaml notebook) may prove
     useful. *)
  let is_row_winning (r: row) = List.exists (fun j -> is_square_2048 j) r

  let is_board_winning (b : board) = List.exists (fun i -> is_row_winning i) b

  (* At this point you should be able to run the tests again to check
     that your implementation is correct. *)

  (********* Step 2 *********)

  (* The next step is to implement the logic for sliding boards up,
     down, left and right. *)

  (* TODO: Implement the `shift_left_helper` to support the left shift
     action, by building a new_row step by step.
     You'll need to consider the following cases:

     - The row is empty.  There's nothing to do except return the
     accumulated `new_row` list.

     - The first square is unoccupied (`None`).  Add it to `new_row`
       and process the rest of the row.

     - The first two squares are occupied by equal tiles.  Merge them
       together, add an entry to the `new_row` list, and process the
       rest of the row.

     - The first square is occupied, but the second square is
       unoccupied.  Move the unoccupied square to the `new_row` list
       and reprocess the row.

     - The first square is occupied and not covered by the cases
       above.  Move on to processing the rest of the list.

     Hint: use pattern matching on r and recursion. *)
  let rec shift_left_helper (r : row) (new_row: row) : row = r

  let shift_left (r : row) = shift_left_helper r []

  (* TODO: Implement the `shift_board` function using
     `shift_left_helper`.  Hint: how can you implement a right shift
     in terms of a left shift?  How can you implement an up shift in
     terms of a left shift? *)
  (* Shift a row in the specified direction according to the rules of the game. *)
  let rec shift_board (mv : move) (b : board) : board = b
  (* TODO.  Hint: use pattern matching on mv and shift_left, List.rev
     and Utils.transpose. *)

  (********* Step 3 *********)

  (* The next step is to implement a function for adding new tiles to
     the board after a move. *)

  (* TODO: Implement the `insert_square` function.  You might like to
     start by implementing a function `insert_into_row`, perhaps using
     `Utils.replace_one`.  You may find it simplest to simply insert
     the tile in the first empty space.  There'll be an opportunity
     for a more interesting implementation in step 6. *)
  let insert_square (sq : square) (b : board) : board option = None

  (* There's a minor milestone at this point: if the tests pass then
     the game should be somewhat playable.  (The sliding animations
     won't appear until you've completed step 5.)  You can try out the
     game by loading `2048/_build/src/2048.html` in a browser. *)

  (********* Step 4 *********)

  (* You've written have a check for a winning board, but we don't yet
     have a way to check whether the game has been lost.  The game is
     lost when it's no longer possible to make a move. *)

  (* TODO: Write a function `is_complete_row`.  A row is considered
     complete if there are no empty squares and if a shift leaves it
     unchanged. *)
  let rec is_complete_row (r : row) : bool = true

  (* TODO: Using `is_complete_row`, write a function `is_game_over`.
     Don't forget to run the tests! *)
  let is_game_over (b : board) = false

  (********* Step 5 *********)

  (* At this point it's possible to play the game, but the tiles leap
     disconcertingly around the board rather than sliding smoothly.
     Sliding animations require keeping track of where tiles came
     from: their *provenance*, a count of the number of squares a tile has slid. *)

  (* TODO: Change the definition of the `tile` type in `g2048.ml` to
     include provenance: {| type tile = int * provenance list |}

     You'll need to reorder the type definitions so that `provenance`
     is defined before `tile`.  *)
  let square_provenances (sq : square) = [] (* TODO *)

  (* TODO: Update the function `square_provenances` to return the
     actual provenance (where available) rather than an empty list. *)

  (* TODO: Update the shift functions (`shift_left` etc.) to keep
     track of provenance. *)

  (* TODO: Update any other functions (e.g. `string_of_square`) which
     no longer compile with the new definition of `tile`. *)

  (* Once the provenance tests pass you can run the game again and see
     the sliding animations in action! *)

  (********* Step 6: Roll the Dice *********)

  (* Always inserting squares in the first empty space makes the game
     much less challenging.  See if you can update `insert_square` to
     use a random empty position instead (perhaps using
     `Utils.replace_at`).  Don't forget to check that the tests still
     pass! *)

  (********* Step 7: Allow Only Valid Moves *********)

  (* Currently, the game allows the player to make moves which don't
     change the state of the game, meaning that a player can easily
     generate a new tile without needing to shift tiles in a direction
     they don't want to.  The game becomes more challenging, though, if only
     moves which change the board state are allowed.  Implement `is_valid_move`
     and check its value before allowing a board shift to continue.
  *)

  let is_valid_move (mv : move) (b : board) = true

  (********* Step 8: Animate Only Valid Moves *********)

  (* At this point, when the player attempts an invalid move, the tiles will
     still be animated as if they had just been moved.  Change `game_move` to
     clear the provenance of tiles after an invalid move to avoid this
     disconcerting animation artifact, and you'll have a fully-functional 2048!
